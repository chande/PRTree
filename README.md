Prefix-Region Tree in Java

The DBProject and TrieLAIS directories were created in Eclipse. If you use Eclipse, I would imagine that importing the directories themselves will allow you to use the programs as you would with anything else.

Otherwise, the src/ directories contain straightforward data files, which can be used like any other plain Java project.

This contains the PR-Tree implementation, in PRTRee.java. The constructPRTree and kNNQuery algorithms are here. Currently, the main() function does not print any search results, but performs the benchmarking test instead.
